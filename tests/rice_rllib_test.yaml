# Checkpoint saving setting
saving:
    metrics_log_freq: 100 # how often (in iterations) to log (and print) the metrics
    model_params_save_freq: 1000 # how often (in iterations) to save the model parameters
    basedir: "/tmp" # base folder used for saving
    name: "rice" # experiment name

# Trainer settings
trainer:
    num_envs: 1
    rollout_fragment_length: 100
    train_batch_size: 20
    num_episodes: 1 # This will cause one iteration only
    framework: torch # framework setting.
    # Note: RLlib supports TF as well, but our end-to-end pipeline is built for Pytorch only.
    # === Hardware Settings ===
    num_workers: 1 # number of rollout worker actors to create for parallel sampling.
    # Note: Setting the num_workers to 0 will force rollouts to be done in the trainer actor.
    num_gpus: 0 # number of GPUs to allocate to the trainer process. This can also be fractional (e.g., 0.3 GPUs).

# Environment configuration
env:
    num_discrete_action_levels: 10 # number of discrete levels for the saving and mitigation actions
    negotiation_on: False # flag to indicate whether negotiation is allowed or not

# Policy network settings
policy:
    regions:
        vf_loss_coeff: 0.1 # loss coefficient schedule for the value function loss
        entropy_coeff_schedule: # loss coefficient schedule for the entropy loss
        # piecewise linear, specified as (timestep, value)

        clip_grad_norm: True # flag indicating whether to clip the gradient norm or not
        max_grad_norm: 0.5 # when clip_grad_norm is True, the clip level
        gamma: 0.92 # discount factor
