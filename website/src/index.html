            <h2>We need global cooperation to mitigate climate change</h2>
            <p>
              Climate change is happening quicker than we have feared.

              The latest <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/">IPCC
                report</a> warns that it is <strong>‘now or never’</strong> if world is to stave off climate disaster.

              However, it is still <a href="https://www.un.org/en/un75/climate-crisis-race-we-can-win">a race we can
                win</a>, capping global temperature increase at 2 degrees Celsius.
            </p>
            <p>
              To mitigate climate change, we need comprehensive long-term global cooperation.

              This poses a complex game-theoretic problem.

              There is no central entity that forces regions to adhere to climate
              agreements, while regions have individual
              policy objectives that are often misaligned.
            </p>
            <p>
              This challenge sits in the intersection of machine learning, game theory, economics, and climate modeling. This is an underexplored area of research that is highly relevant to real-world policymaking.
            </p>

            <h2>Develop, design, and compete with your solution!</h2>
            <p>
              The goal is to design multilateral negotiation protocols and agreements that incentivize
              cooperation
              on climate change. These solutions will be tested in a simulation with AI agents that is calibrated to
              real-world
              data.
            </p>
            <p>
              We call on computer scientists, economists, climate scientists, and policy experts to collaborate on designing negotiation protocols between (fictitous) regions and evaluating their impact on climate change using climate-economic simulations (provided by us) with AI agents.
            </p>            
          
            <h2>Why participate?</h2>

            <p>
              First of all, come learn.

              We want to motivate you to do original research in this scientific area.

              Our jury will also provide feedback on your solutions and ideas.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>We will organize a workshop in December 2022.</b>

              Top performing teams will be invited to present their work there. We also invite all teams to submit a workshop-style paper to document their findings, which will be peer-reviewed and published in the competition proceedings.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>We plan to write a research paper based on the findings in the competition, coauthored with selected teams.</b> We will invite teams as coauthors whose findings are of sufficient scientific or policymaking novelty. This work will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. This work will also be reviewed for ethical use.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Given sufficient findings, we intend to write a policy brief with actionable insights for policymakers.</b> 
              This brief will be distributed and promoted through our partners. We also plan to organize a marketing campaign, e.g., through blogs, press releases, around the findings of the competition.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, we're looking for interested poeple to join the organization!

            <!-- <h2>What will you do?</h2> -->
            <p>
              The challenge is to implement a negotiation strategy that aligns the incentives for regions to achieve their individual
              goals and also (indirectly) lead to better climate outcomes in the next 100 years.
            </p>

            <p>
              You will use a climate-economic simulation with fictitious regions as independent AI agents. Each agent
              chooses how much to invest and mitigate climate change, sets international tariffs, limits exports, and imports
              goods. Each agent also negotiates with other agents.
            </p>
            <p>
              The base simulation is open-source in our <a href="https://github.com/mila-iqia/climate-cooperation-competition" target="blank">Github
                repository</a>, with structural parameters that have been calibrated to real data.
            </p>
            <p>
              All the technical details of the simulation and evaluation protocol are in our <a href="#resources">technical white paper</a>.

              In this track, you will argue why your solution is practically relevant and usable in the real world.

              As we aim to bring the insights from the competition to policymakers, we expect the entries in this
              track to contain a high-level summary for policymakers.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>How to submit:</b><br>
              In addition to the requirements in Track 1, you should also submit a written summary, justification, and
              explanation of your solution and insights.

              Your write-up should argue why your solution is feasible, technically sound, and attractive.
              For instance, from a game-theoretical perspective, good multilateral agreements might punish free-riders
              and might have to ensure that it’s difficult to “game” agreements with unrealistic behaviours.

              We strive to closely simulate real-world dynamics.
              But, no simulator is perfect.
              Thus, we invite you to point out potential improvements and loopholes.

              While the intention of this paper and the corresponding challenge is to stimulate innovative solutions to climate change, there are some unintended consequences that we would like to acknowledge and address here. These include the carbon footprint of running the simulation itself, the economic disparities that can exist with climate negotiations, and the potential extensibility of this simulation to the real world.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, it is important to acknowledge that running climate change simulations in RICE-N will inevitably release carbon emissions into our atmosphere. While the computational requirements of these simulations are much smaller than training large language models, they still exist. To mitigate this harm, we are encouraging participating teams to consider their energy use during experimentation, offsetting their own carbon emissions if possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Second, as <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/social-dimensions-of-climate-change#1">the World Bank states</a> "Climate change is deeply intertwined with global patterns of inequality" and yet "the most vulnerable are often also disproportionately impacted by measures to address climate change". While it is important to determine ways that to mitigate climate change it is equally important to ensure that vulnerable populations are not negatively impacted by climate change measures.
            </p>
            <p>
              Last but not least, it is important to note that the predicted climate and economic predictions made in RICE-N may differ in a real-world setting due to externalities beyond the boundaries of the simulation. A fictional world is utilized in this competition to further illustrate the potential gap between simulation and reality, but the uncertainty of the results should be fully understood, especially before implementing any policies recommended by RICE-N.
